# Panpermia-Project
Project investigating creation of life

## Overview
This project looks at 2 Poisson Modeled life generation events.  The first is panspermia, which is the idea that life can generate inorganically on a suitable
planet.  The second process, or event, is panspermia.  Panspermia is the theory that life can travel on space debris and can hit a planet and thus transfer life.
In this project, I look at both of them and include some interaction to see how different models could affect ones beliefs in alien life.  The write up explains 
in much more detail, and the code is there for reference
